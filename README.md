# An Alternative to the C++ Piscine
#### As presented by Aneesh Nazar

## Intro

* A lot of modern software development is done in Java, C++, C#, and other object-oriented languages
* As such, it's important for coders, and coding students, to know how to code in these languages
* Fortunately, we have the C++ piscine to learn the paradigm, which also opens up several projects in which we can sharpen our skills
* Cons: I've been here for almost a year, and it's only opened up twice. The first time, I wasn't able to take it because I wasn't a high enough level. I was luckier the second time, but several of my fellow students weren't.
* Also, if a student fails the C++ piscine, they're out of luck, because they have to wait an undefined amount of time until they can take it again.
* In addition, several of the projects opened up by the C++ Piscine aren't even in C++ - Avaj-Launcher is in Java, Swifty-Companion is in Swift, Unity uses C# and Javascript. We have to learn those languages on our own anyway.
* Furthermore, the C++ piscine takes at minimum 15 correction points to validate, and those points "flow upwards", remaining within the pool of people who have done C++.
* As such, I'm proposing an alternative to teach students Object-Oriented programming without having to open up a piscine. A project that can remain open at any time, that can be graded by anyone, and that would teach students the basics of object-oriented programming and give them the tools they need to learn whatever object-oriented language they want to learn.

## Basics

During the C++ Piscine, we learn the basics of Object Oriented programming. I've boiled these basics down to:

* Classes and proper class structure
    - class members
    - class methods
    - private/public members
* Operator and function overloading
* Inheritance
    - protected members
* Abstract classes and interfaces
* Exception handling
* Templates

It should be possible to create a simple project similar to Docker-1, init, or ft_debut that opens up the Object-Oriented branch by teaching the theory behind these principles.

Two options:

1) provide resources folder that the student writes supplementary code for, and tries to match outputs with.

2) 100% theory - student answers questions about OOP and correctors look for keywords. Student googles and discusses answers with peers.
